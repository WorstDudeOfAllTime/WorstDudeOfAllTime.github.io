                <h1 id="intro">Hello, I'm Kris!</h1>
                <p class="bio">     I was born and raised in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. I went through
                    the Upper Darby school system until 11th grade at which point I switched
                    to an online program in which I ultimately taught myself the last 2 years of high school. I attended Delaware County
                    Community College for 2 years before transferring to Drexel University.
                    After 2 terms, I left Drexel for financial reasons. If I am being honest,
                    I was not cut out for college at that point in my life and I would end up not returning.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">I've spent the last decade and a half bouncing from job to job. I've been
                    a mailroom clerk, a dedicated corporate houseman, a line cook, a real estate agent,
                    a junk removalist(?), a billboard photographer, an art handler, and more. I would
                    consider myself a child of the internet and have always been intrigued by web design
                    and development. I'd looked into bootcamps for a couple years and being a natural
                    skeptic I told myself to avoid them. After discussing with some of my dev friends, I was 
                    convinced to jump in and now you are joining me on that journey. 
                </p>
                <p class="bio">In my personal life, I am a long time weight lifter and musician. Both have become more
                    of a hobby, but ultimately music is a passion of mine. I spend a lot of time cycling
                    around Philadelphia with a camera.
                </p>
